Magic+Words says FAhO is a magic word, disagreeing with Jorge's post.


BAhE is not magic
UI is not magic

ZEI acts first, because ZEI is a "magic word" and BAhE isn't.

Magic words are: BU, ZEI, ZO, LOhU-LEhU, ZOI, SI, SA, SU. These are
words that ignore the selma'o of words they act upon. (BAhE on the
other hand respects the selma'o of the word it emphasizes, it doesn't
ignore it like "magic words" do.)

The rule that the camxes parser uses for those word battles is "first
come first served". The jbofi'e parser probably disagrees in some
cases.

BU, ZEI and SI, which act on the "preceding word", will act on a full
prededing block if another word has already acted, so "zo si" forms
one block (controlled by "zo" because it comes first) and the next
"si" will delete the whole block. Another "si" will delete whatever
word precedes that.
