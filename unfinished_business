Or, in other words, "TODO":

###### Soon
 - More error checking and recovery
 - Make the helper code nicer
 + Make --token-error print a backtrace on each token instead of dieing
 + Check your dotside!
 - Implement more command line options (And --arg=value ?)
 - Do more garbage checking (Put {kl√°ma} in with the default settings)
 + Put stdin into Configuration. Probably the best way to deal with quotes
 - make word_end indexed from 0 instead of 1
 - Check old comments for validity
 - Don't use self.config, use self.buffer.config

###### Later

 - Check that each marker in brkwords is properly implemented and documented
 - Add an "--abusive" option zo'o
 - Check for TODO/XXX in code
 + (Have error messages in lojban?)
 - Make sure I didn't accidentally change/deleting anything in BRKWORDS.txt
 - (seperate out the configuration options for each section?)

###### Much Later

 - Study and meditate upon lojban grammar
 - Make a parser for the grammar (In another file, of course...)
 - Emulate output of jbofihe and camxes (Anybody else?)
 - Semantics engine and supporting stuff
 - Jbovlaste
 + Oh, also, learn how to speak lojban. Jeeze.




###### Never

 - Make option for output to be spaceless
