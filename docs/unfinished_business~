Or, in other words, "TODO":

###### Soon
 - More error checking and recovery
 - Make the helper code nicer
 - Make --token-error print a backtrace on each token instead of dieing?
 + Check your dotside!
 - Do more garbage checking (For example, try {kl√°ma} with default settings)
 + Put stdin into Configuration. Probably the best way to deal with quotes
 - make word_end in morphology.py indexed from 0 instead of 1
 - Don't use self.config, use self.buffer.config
 + Test IPA and other alphabets
 - Check the bottom of the BNF. Are there non-formal rules?
 + Use GNU readline! Not being able to edit lines in jbofihe is /so/ annoying
 + Go through morph_test_sentences.txt

###### Later

 - Check that each marker in brkwords is properly implemented and documented
 - Add an "--abusive" option zo'o
 - Check for TODO/XXX in code
 + (Have error messages in lojban?)
 - Make sure I didn't accidentally change/deleting anything in BRKWORDS.txt
 - (seperate out the configuration options for each section?)

###### Much Later

 - Study and meditate upon lojban grammar
 - Make a parser for the grammar (In another file, of course...)
 - Emulate output of jbofihe and camxes (And other parsers?)
 - Semantics engine and supporting stuff
 - Jbovlaste
 + Oh, also, learn how to speak lojban. Jeeze.
 - Make option for output to be spaceless
 - Make a funny/bad// joke about {tosmabru}
