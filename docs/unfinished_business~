Or, in other words, "TODO":

###### !!Now!!
  

###### Soon
 - More error checking and recovery
 + lerfu!
 + EncodingTable vs. GlyphTable! !??!
 - Make the helper code nicer
 - Make --token-error print a backtrace on each token instead of dieing?
 + Check your dotside!
 - Do more garbage checking (For example, try {kl√°ma} with default settings)
 + Put stdin into Configuration. Probably the best way to deal with quotes
 - make word_end in morphology.py indexed from 0 instead of 1
 - Don't use self.config, use self.buffer.config? (the way it is now is more flexible)
 + Test IPA and other alphabets
 - Check the bottom of the BNF. Are there non-formal rules?
 - Handle whitespace so that the fact that there is a word seperation is returned immediatly, instead of reading 'til the first non-whitespace. Possibilities include returning a Bit for each whitespace, returning a Bit for the first whitespace and merging the rest, or returning a bit that has no value, but is treated as a whitespace, and having the actual whitespace slurped up later.
 - Study and meditate upon lojban grammar, make grammar parser
 - Check that I'm parsing the BNF correctly. For example, the &'s in "simple-tense-modal" (I don't know for certain that the way it parses is correct)

###### Later

 - Check that each marker in brkwords is properly implemented and documented
 - Add an "--abusive" option zo'o
 - Check for TODO/XXX in code
 + (Have error messages in lojban?)
 - Make sure I didn't accidentally change/deleting anything in BRKWORDS.txt
 - (seperate out the configuration options for each section?)
 - It would be interesting to have an option to disable line-buffering; the user could see the immediate tokenization.
 - How do I like Position?
 - Do I like how the Configuration object is propagated?
 - Make GlyphTable handle multi-length inputs?

###### Much Later

 - Emulate output of jbofihe and camxes? (And other parsers?)
 - Semantics engine and supporting stuff
 - Jbovlaste
 + Oh, also, learn how to speak lojban. Jeeze.
 - Make option for output to be spaceless
 - Make a funny/bad// joke about {tosmabru}
 - If there is demand: xml output
 - look into proper distribution methods, see the distutils module http://docs.python.org/distutils/
     "package_data" for setup.py


###### Some things I've completed, to make me feel special
 + Use GNU readline! Not being able to edit lines in jbofihe is /so/ annoying
 + Go through morph_test_sentences.txt (And also, get a URL and an original copy)
    (Okay, only half-heartedly. It wasn't so useful.)
 - Make stream(config, stdin) more like stream(stdin, config=None) and make config take care of itself
 - Make thaumatology.py not print valsi type
Ortohgraphy - what happens to capitalized letters with strict ortho?
    * they are garbage
  Resolve recursive import failures
    * done
