For the lazy:
  python3.0 dendrograpy.py


BRKWORDS.TXT has my comments regarding morphology, I've also included the original file in this directory.

unfinished_business is the todo list


To start parsing something, first pick what depth you want. Do you want orthography, morphology, thaumatology or dendrography?


If all you want are valsi, than you can do:



  import morphology
  import tokens

  stream = morphology.Stream()
  #module.Stream() returns an iter()-able parser
  vals = list(_ for _ in stream if not isinstance(_, tokens.BORING))
  
  print("There are", len(vals), "tokens.")


The vals variable will now have a list of Token objects.
You can also set a bunch of options using the Configuration object, which is located in the config module.


  import orthography
  import config

  conf = config.Configuration([]) #The empty list prevents Configuration from parsing arguments from sys.argv
  conf.alphabet = config.alphabets.liberal

  for c in orthography.Stream(conf):
    print(c, end='')

  print()
