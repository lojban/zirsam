If you don't modify the bnf, then you don't need to look at anything in this directory









This directoy contains all of the stuff used to create the bnf.py file. You'll only need it you're haxxing up the BNF file.

Run dehtml_bnf.py; it uses that chapter from the CLL that contains the BNF. Download & save it as "bnf.html". I used donri's at dag.github.com/cll. The original draft version from lojban.org probably won't work because it isn't broken up into chunks. The dehtml_bnf.py script uses w3m to extract the BNF data from the HTML. You'll need to have w3m installed, of course. The file gets saved to src_bnf.bnf
	./dehtml_bnf.py
Then, run convert_bnf.py. It will turn that perfectly good albeit redundently named src_bnf.bnf into a fugly bnf.py file.
	./convert_bnf.py
You should check that file to make sure that python likes it.
	python ./bnf.py






Of course, you might say, "If you can't even write an EBNF parser, how could you possibly write a lojban parser?", to which I reply http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ptitlem4f37xq499gk?from=Main.AttentionDeficitOohShiny . But seriously, wouldn't one of those actually be more LoC than this? :P
