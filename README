INSTALLATION
============
1) There must be a 'python3' command in the $PATH. The easiest way to do this
     sudo ln /usr/bin/python3.0 /usr/bin/python3
   The other versions in the py3k series will work, of course.
2) Update the BNF data. The following command should be run as a user
     ./setup.py build
3) Then install the program, with admin privlidges
     sudo ./setup.py install


If you are unable to install it, you may be able to access the demo on my box by:
  ssh zirsam@neptune.wtf.la
The password is "lojban".


USAGE
=====
Installing the library also installs a command for running the parser from the command line:
  zirsam
This command will output a condensed parse tree.

To start parsing something using the actual library, first pick what depth you want. Do you want orthography (letters), morphology (words), thaumatology (metasyntax/pre-processing) or dendrography (grammar parsing)?
If all you want are valsi (morphology), then a program using this might be:

  import zirsam.morphology
  import zirsam.tokens

  stream = zirsam.morphology.Stream()
  #In general, module.Stream() returns an iter object
  valsi = list(_ for _ in stream if not isinstance(_, tokens.BORING))
  
  print("There are", len(valsi), "tokens.")

The valsi variable will now have a list of Token objects.
Options can be set using the Configuration object, which is located in the config module.

  import zirsam.orthography
  import zirsam.config

  conf = zirsam.config.Configuration([]) #The empty list prevents Configuration from parsing arguments from sys.argv
  conf.alphabet = zirsam.config.alphabets.liberal #This could also be passed in the list to Configuration(), similiar to the 'zirsam' program

  for c in zirsam.orthography.Stream(conf):
    print(c, end='')

  print()


DOCUMENTATION NOT REALLY
========================
docs/BRKWORDS.TXT has my comments regarding morphology, I've also included the original file in this directory.

docs/unfinished_business is the todo list

Many directories have README files.

TESTING
=======
I've got two scripts to test zirsam: one to test morphology, the other to test grammar. They are under tools/test_* . The test lines for the grammar (zirsam/data/gram_test_sentences [TODO I moved this]) are from rlpowell's website.
